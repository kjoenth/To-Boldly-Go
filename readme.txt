Known bugs: 
-Very, very rarely TBG will generate a random star name that matches the name of a stock body. Kopernicus hangs when this happens.
-All Gas giants are bright purple

Changes:

0.4.1
-Fixed non-printing character in pqsTmp.txt file that cause Kopernicus to hang
-Added template file and ability to make procedural maps for PsiCartographer
-Reduced galaxy size by a lot (stars should be closer together)
-dialed down the max number of stars made automatically
-included an option to make a galaxy for use with Psi-Cartographer
-Continued compatability with:
	 -ResearchBodies
	 -EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements & StockVisualEnhancements (clouds for procedural water, Eve, and kethane worlds)
-Moon generation is still disabled
-Keep an eye out for easter eggs on water worlds
