True, Moho, 250000, 9646660, "A red rocky world. Dull and barren, But here in the void. It is all a blessing just to find this world."
True, Eve, 700000, 85109360, "A world with a thick purple sky. And a great ocean. Vast rocky plains. And great winds."
True, Gilly, 13000, 126120, "placeholder"
True, Mun, 200000, 2429560, "A dull rocky cratered planet. Probably not worth it, But if your desparate, Then this is your place."
True, Minmus, 60000, 2429560, "A small planet covered in ice plains and salt flats."
True, Duna, 320000, 47921950, "A red world. Quite uninviting to Kerbals due to it's red shade of ground."
True, Ike, 130000, 1049600, "A dull grey little planet covered in basic rocky plains."
True, Dres, 138000, 32832840, "A dull grey little planet covered in basic rocky plains."
True, Jool, 6000000, 2455985190, "In the starlight light, Floats a gas giant, %(sN)s %(rN)s is a large planet with several moons."

False, Cyran, 8000000, 2455985190, "A huge and somewhat angry looking gas giant, Cyran is as much loved as it is feared. The decay of radioactive elements in the planet's core have heated up the planet, and thus it seems to glow. It is also quite warm close to this planet due to the heat generated by the radioactive decay, so be careful with aerobraking, you might just melt from the sheer temperature of the atmosphere. The heat does mean that orbiting stations can cut back on the heating fee, however."
